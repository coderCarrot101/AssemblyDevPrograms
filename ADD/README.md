This code and EXE file take two user inputs as ASCII strings, converts it to a decimal number, does necessary math (in this case ADD) and then converts it back to a string for output

MAIN POINTERS:

The most important aspect of this program is the two conversions that happen, which will be needed for any program that takes input ad does math
