# AssemblyDevPrograms
A repo made up of useful code and programs that I stitched together to help me and others learn MASM

I am currently in the process of learning the MASM32 language and library, these programs are made with only the MASM32 library and none others (unless specified). 
You will need the MASM32 library to compile any changes
